## General info
This game was made as a project for a course in school and is intended to be used for that.
If anyone wants to try out the game it's fine to do so but it's a very rough app and not very optimized.

The game is a simple treasure hunt esque game where the player can create their own routes and then play the routes trying to finish the routes as fast as possible.
The app generates QR-codes witch will have to be printed out on paper if they want to play the game as intended.
You place the QR-codes in hidden locations and when a QR-code is scanned it reveals where the next QR-code is hidden.
When all QR-codes have been scanned the time taken will be saved as a highscore and the lowest time will be first placed.
